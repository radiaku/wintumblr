WinTumblr is a tumblr client that allows you to post entries to your tumblr log without you having to log into your tumblr dashboard. WinTumblr is ideal for quickly posting the following types of entries: video, photo, link, quote, and chat. It is not ideal for longer regular text posts as it is lacking a spell checker and a HTML formatter to easily create links or highlight words.

WinTumblr is developed using .NET 2 and coded in C#.
